# What is it?
The [EspoTek Labrador](http://espotek.com/labrador) is an open-source board that turns your PC, Raspberry Pi, or Android Smartphone into a full-featured electronics lab bench, complete with oscilloscope, signal generator, and more.

This repo hosts all of the software and hardware that makes Labrador possible.

# Tutorial
If you're new to Labrador or oscilloscopes in general, I strongly recommend checking out the fantastic [tutorial series](https://www.wellys.com/posts/courses_electronics/) produced by Lief Koepsel.  It features well-written, rich articles as well as video content that explains everything more clearly than I ever could!

# Getting Started
Binary (executable) versions of the software are available for [download](https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/releases) for several platforms.

For the documentation, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/wiki).

## Building from Source
If you're looking to build from source but don't know where to start, Qt Creator is the easiest way to get your toes wet!  
https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/  
When installing, make sure you tick the box to install Qt 5.15 or later.

Once it's installed, open `Desktop_Interface/Labrador.pro`, then Clean All -> Run `qmake` -> Build All.

If you're on Linux (including Raspberry Pi), then you can also build the software from source by cloning the repo, `cd`ing to the `Desktop_Interface` directory, then running:  
```
QT_SELECT=qt5 qmake
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
Then, to launch, just type `labrador` into the terminal.  Additional packages may be required, please see the full [build instructions](https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/wiki/Building-from-source) on the wiki.

On macOS, additional steps may be required.  See issue https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/issues/238

To build the AVR software, I use Atmel Studio 7.  Just load up the .atsln and push F7.  You can use `avr-gcc` if you don't want to install a full IDE.

The PCB files can be edited in KiCAD 5.0 or later.
